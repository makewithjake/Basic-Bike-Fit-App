# Cycl3D Basic Bike Fit Tool

**Built by [Make with Jake LLC](https://cycl3d.com) · [cycl3d.com](https://cycl3d.com)**

A free, browser-based bike fit tool that helps riders understand and adjust their bike fit at a macro level. Upload a side-view photo, place joint markers, and instantly receive angle analysis and fit recommendations tailored to your riding style.

While not intended to replace an in-person professional bike fit, this tool gives new and experienced riders alike a way to understand bike fit mechanics, visualize joint angles, and explore how positional changes affect their overall fit — all for free.

## Why This Tool Exists

Many AI-driven bike fit apps charge $10–$100 for limited-time access, with restrictions on the number of bikes and fits per session. This tool aims to offer a straightforward, free alternative that anyone can use without barriers.

## How to Use

1. Take a clear side-view photo of yourself on your bike. The full bike and rider should be visible, with the pedal at the 6 o'clock position and hands on the hoods.
2. Upload the photo using the **Upload Side-View Photo** button.
3. Select your preferred riding style from the dropdown.
4. Starting with the **Toe**, click to place each joint marker in order: Toe → Ankle → Knee → Hip → Shoulder → Elbow → Hand.
5. Click and drag any marker to fine-tune its position.
6. Review the calculated angles and recommendations in the results area below the photo.
7. Optionally save your session or download a PDF report.
