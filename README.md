Basic Bike Fit App by Make with Jake LLC/Cycl3D

The goal is to develop a web based app that can assist a rider in adjusting their bike fit at a macro level.  While not (currently) designed to replace an in person bike fit, this tool can be used for a new rider to understand bike fit mechanics and understand the effect a change may have on the fit of their bike.

it may also be an alterative to expensive AI driven bike apps, which can cost $10-$100 for a short amount of time, with limitations on # of bikes and # of fits per bike.  This app aims to compete by not only being simple to use, but free as well.
